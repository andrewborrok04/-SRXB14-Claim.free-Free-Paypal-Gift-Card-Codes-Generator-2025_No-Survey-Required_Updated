Score a PayPal Gift Card for Free the Easy Way
PayPal gift cards seem to be all the rage right now because of how useful they areâ€”PayPal can be used for paying for virtually any service or product nationwide. But what is a PayPal gift card actually? Is it a real PayPal-branded gift card that you can purchase and redeem? Can you even get a PayPal gift card for free? The answers are a bit complicated.

PayPal is not a retailer, so the option of standard gift cards that can be used to purchase different types of products or services is out of the window. Instead, there are several different card types people refer to when they talk about PayPal gift cards. We'll cover all of them in this comprehensive article and show you how you can use your gift card online.

The good news is that, despite all the scams out there that exist solely to steal your personal information, you can find a PayPal gift card for free without compromising your cyber securityâ€”with Mode Mobileâ€™s money-earning app and phone!

Do PayPal Gift Cards Even Exist?
If youâ€™re planning to buy, say, a $25 PayPal gift card and give it to a friend because you donâ€™t know what else to buy for them, youâ€™re in for a disappointment. PayPal doesnâ€™t offer conventional gift cards, like Starbucks or Amazon gift cards that weâ€™re used to.

There are four distinct card types people refer to when talking about PayPal gift cards:

Prepaid debit cards issued by various card providers that you can link with your PayPal account
PayPal Prepaid Mastercard
PayPal Cash Card
Digital gift cards you can buy from PayPalâ€™s Digital Gifts store
Weâ€™ll clarify the differences and tell you more about each type.

One limitation of using these cards on PayPal is worth notingâ€”these gift cards can be used to pay for any product or service via PayPal except for recurring payments and reference transactions. This is because gift card balances can become low at critical moments when certain services need to be renewed. To ensure uninterrupted service, PayPal does not allow you to pay for such services with prepaid gift cards.
